  abstract="The unrestricted circuit complexity C(.) over the basis of all logic 2-input/1-output gates is considered. It is proved that certain explicitly defined families of permutations {\{}fn{\}} are feebly-one-way of order 2, i.e., the functions fn satisfy the property that, for increasing n, C(fn−1) approaches 2 {\textperiodcentered} C(fn) while C(fn) tends to infinity. Both these functions and their corresponding complexities are derived by a method that exploits certain graphs called (n−1,s)-stars.",

  abstract="Pseudorandom generators transform in polynomial time a short random ``seed'' into a long ``pseudorandom'' string. This string cannot be random in the classical sense of [6], but testing that requires an unrealistic amount of time (say, exhaustive search for the seed). Such pseudorandom generators were first discovered in [2] assuming that the function (axmodb) is one-way, i.e., easy to compute, but hard to invert on a noticeable fraction of instances. In [12] this assumption was generalized to the existence of any one-way permutation. The permutation requirement is sufficient but still very strong. It is unlikely to be proven necessary, unless something crucial, like P=NP, is discovered. Below, among other observations, a weaker assumption about one-way functions is proposed, which is not only sufficient, but also necessary for the existence of pseudorandom generators.",
