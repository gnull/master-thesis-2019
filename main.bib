  abstract="The unrestricted circuit complexity C(.) over the basis of all logic 2-input/1-output gates is considered. It is proved that certain explicitly defined families of permutations {\{}fn{\}} are feebly-one-way of order 2, i.e., the functions fn satisfy the property that, for increasing n, C(fn−1) approaches 2 {\textperiodcentered} C(fn) while C(fn) tends to infinity. Both these functions and their corresponding complexities are derived by a method that exploits certain graphs called (n−1,s)-stars.",

  abstract="In 1992, A. Hiltgen provided first construction of provably (slightly) secure cryptographic primitives, namely, feebly one-way functions. These functions are provably harder to invert than to compute, but the complexity (viewed as the circuit complexity over circuits with arbitrary binary gates) is amplified only by a constant factor (in Hiltgen's works, the factor approaches 2).",
